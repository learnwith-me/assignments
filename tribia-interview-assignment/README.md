# About Document Management System

The provided project is a React-based web application that serves as a document management system. It allows users to upload, preview, and download documents. The application utilizes React's useState and useEffect hooks for state management and initialization. Uploaded documents are stored in the documents state array, and users can interact with them through a user-friendly interface. Document previews are displayed in an iframe, and notifications are triggered for successful uploads and downloads using the react-notifications library. The code demonstrates fundamental concepts of React, file handling, and UI interaction.
